      <P>There are laws that govern the combination of simple substance to form complex substance. The simple substance are called REACTANTS while the comple substance are called PRODUCT. The laws of chemical combination are those  laws that govern the changes from reactant to product involving teh mass, volume moles and their relationship. There are generally four basic laws of chemical combination which include the following; </P>
      <ol>
          <li>The laws of conservation of matter</li>
          <li>The laws of reciprocal proportion</li>
          <li>The laws of constant composition</li>
          <li>The laws of multiple proportion</li>
        </ol>
          <h4>THE LAWS OF CONSERVATION OF MATTER</h4>
          <P>This is also known as the law of conservation of mass. This laws state that matter is neither created nor destroyed in course of chemical reaction. This law simply means that the total mass of the product of a chemical reaction is equal to the total mass of the reaacting substance of a chemical reaction.</P>
         <h4 class="text-align">EXAMPLES TO VERIFY TEH LAW OF CONSERVATION OF MATTER</h4>
        <h5>EXAMPLE I ;</h5>
       <h4>sodium chloride solution reacts with silver trioxonitrate[v] to produce silver chloride and sodium trioxonitrate.</h4>
       <h4>Solution</h4> 
       <div>   
       Equation of the reaction;<br>
                  Nacl + AgNo3 --->NaNo3 + Agcl<br>
RMM=23+35..5 + 108+62   37 + 48 + 108 +35..5<br>
     58.5 + 170 ---> 85 + 143.5<br>
     228.5  ----> 228.5
